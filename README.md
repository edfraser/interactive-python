==================

Coursera "Interactive python" from Rice University
This readme describes how to run code found in the "interactive-python" repository

Edmund Fraser's class project code:
Coursera, "Interactive Python" from Rice University

This class is taught using a browser based python interpreter, which is actually written in javascript
Most code herein imports a class called 'simplegui' that only works within this browser based interpreter
Browser based interpreter found at: http://www.codeskulptor.org/
1. Open codeskulptor.org: When code skulptor opens, it defaults to some generic code. Replace that code with code of interest found in this repository
2. Execute python code: press the Run Button, which is found in the upper left corner of blue title bar
